                    <h2>2nd Year Project</h2>
                    <p>
                    In 2nd year we were tasked in making an MVC web app. This was done in teams of 3. 
                    For this project my team mates and I decided we would be using the Play Framework.
                    This had a built in H2 local database which we used to store employee objects, product objects and order projects.
                    It was my job to design the site. I used Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS to make the site look how we wanted it to look.
                    The site had many images and a lot of these images transitioned when hovered over, giving the site a very professional look.
                    I created my own images for the site just to give it a more personal touch instead of just taking everything off the web.
                    To create my own images I used Photoshop CC. This enabled me to make images exactly how I wanted them to look and 
                    it helped me edit them to match the site accordingly.

                        <h2>2nd Year Project</h2>
                        <p>
                        In 3rd year we were tasked in developing a project of our choice. This could be a game, a web app, a mobile app.
                        This was done in teams of 2 and me and my team mate decided to do an MVC Ecommerce Web App.
                        Same idea as last year but I wanted it to be more complex. For this project I created the backend in Python using
                        Django Framework. This was new to me and presented a challange as I had to learn from scratch on my own how to use Python.
                        The challange is why I used Django as I wanted to show my lecturers that I was pushing myself in trying something new and
                        not just using the same software as before. The frontend was made using Angular2. This was also used in accordance with Node.js.

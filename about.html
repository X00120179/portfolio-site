            <h1>About This Site</h1>
            <hr>
            <p text-left>Hi and thank you for viewing my portfolio site!</p>
            <p>My name is Lee Healy and I am 21 years of age, currently studying Computer Science in my final year (4th) in The Institute of Technology Tallaght, Dublin, Ireland.</p>
            <p>This website was created as a project given out by my lecture for my Interactive Media Design module.</p>
            <p>This website gives you an insight into the work I have done over the last 3-4 years at the Institue. Media design is where i'd have most interest in web development. 
                I enjoy creating dynamic websites from scratch and building them to look professional. 
                As you may have seen on the home page, I have created many of my own images for this site. These images were created using Photoshop CC.
                I rather make most of the images myself as I feel this gives the site a more personal touch and due to the nature of the site 
                and the fact that this site is about me and my work, I think that the small personal details give you greater insight into my work.
                I am very much a team player and enjoy working with others and sharing the equal workload or helping others with their work if they are stuck, especially when deadlines are due or if someone is struggling. I am all for helping others.
            </p>
            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>I have a strong interest in computer hardware, computer software, development and design, technologies, gadgets, and games.
